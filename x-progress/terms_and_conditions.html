                <p>These terms and conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Mobile Application
                    Developer ("Mobile Application Developer", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your").
                    This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the X Progress mobile
                    application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services").

                <h2>Accounts and Membership</h2>
                <p>If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security
                    of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and
                    any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review
                    new accounts before you may sign in and use our Services. Providing false contact information of any
                    kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any
                    unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any
                    acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
                    omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine
                    that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to
                    damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not
                    re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to
                    prevent further registration.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>User Content</h2>
                <p>We do not own any data, information or material ("Content") that you submit in the Mobile Application
                    in the course of using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality,
                    integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to
                    use of all submitted Content. We may monitor and review Content in the Mobile Application submitted
                    or created using our Services by you. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the Mobile
                    Application does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute
                    the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar
                    purpose. But you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display
                    and perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the
                    Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right,
                    though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our
                    reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Billing and Payments</h2>
                <p>You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing
                    terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Where Services are offered on a free
                    trial basis, payment may be required after the free trial period ends, and not when you enter your
                    billing details (which may be required prior to the commencement of the free trial period). If
                    auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed for, you will be charged automatically
                    in accordance with the term you selected. Sensitive and private data exchange between the Mobile
                    Application and its Users happens over a SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and
                    protected with digital signatures. If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk
                    transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo
                    identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used for
                    the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing at any time. We also
                    reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or
                    cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include
                    orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use
                    the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order,
                    we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided
                    at the time the order was made.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
                <p>Occasionally there may be information in the Mobile Application that contains typographical errors,
                    inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to availability, promotions and offers. We reserve the
                    right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update information or
                    cancel orders if any information in the Mobile Application or on any related Service is inaccurate
                    at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). We undertake no
                    obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Mobile Application including, without
                    limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh date
                    applied in the Mobile Application should be taken to indicate that all information in the Mobile
                    Application or on any related Service has been modified or updated.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Backups</h2>
                <p>We are not responsible for Content residing in the Mobile Application. In no event shall we be held
                    liable for any loss of any Content. It is your sole responsibility to maintain appropriate backup of
                    your Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with
                    absolutely no obligation, we may be able to restore some or all of your data that has been deleted
                    as of a certain date and time when we may have backed up data for our own purposes. We make no
                    guarantee that the data you need will be available.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Links to Other Mobile Applications</h2>
                <p>Although this Mobile Application may link to other mobile applications, we are not, directly or
                    indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any
                    linked mobile application, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining
                    or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content
                    of their mobile applications. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions,
                    products, services, and content of any other third-parties. You should carefully review the legal
                    statements and other conditions of use of any mobile application which you access through a link
                    from this Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site mobile applications is at your own
                    risk.

                    be used in any way that will affect the functionality or operation of the Service or of any related
                    mobile application, other mobile applications, or the Internet; (h) to collect or track the personal
                    information of others; (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (j) for any

                    of the prohibited uses.
